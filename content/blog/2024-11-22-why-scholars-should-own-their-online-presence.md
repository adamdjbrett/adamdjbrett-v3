## A Domain of One's Own

In the digital age, having a domain name is a critical step for scholars to establish their professional identity. A personal domain name, such as "FirstNameLastName.com," signals authority and permanence. Unlike social media platforms, which can change policies or even shut down, a custom domain provides a stable foundation for an academic's online presence. It also lends credibility to their work, as a dedicated web address conveys professionalism and makes it easier for colleagues, students, and collaborators to locate relevant information about their research and publications. For scholars who aim to control how they are perceived online, owning a domain is non-negotiable  (Cf. [A Brief History of A Domain of One's Own](http://umwdtlt.com/a-brief-history-of-domain-of-ones-own-part-two-the-12-days-of-domains/)).  

Creating and maintaining a professional website is the logical next step for academics seeking to showcase their achievements. A well-designed website can serve as a digital portfolio, featuring a CV, publications, teaching resources, and links to external projects. Such a site centralizes information, making it accessible to diverse audiences. Moreover, owning and managing the website ensures that the scholar has full control over its content and design, avoiding dependency on external platforms that might introduce ads or unrelated distractions. For scholars in fields like history or religious studies, where nuanced presentations of complex ideas matter, a self-owned website allows for a thoughtful and intentional representation of their work.
