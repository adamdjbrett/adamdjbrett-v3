## Why Eleventy Is the Best Static Site Generator Around

When it comes to building websites, static site generators (SSGs) have become a popular choice for developers who want fast, secure, and easily maintainable sites. Among the many options available, [Eleventy | 11ty](https://1ty.dev) stands out as one of the best. Lightweight yet powerful, Eleventy offers flexibility and simplicity that make it a top-tier choice. But how does Eleventy stack up against WordPress, the reigning CMS heavyweight, or Jekyll, another beloved SSG? Let's break it down.


### **1. Eleventy vs. WordPress**

WordPress has long been a go-to solution for building websites, but its reliance on dynamic content generation comes with significant trade-offs. Here's why [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) wins:

#### **Performance**

WordPress generates pages dynamically on each request, which can slow down loading times---especially for high-traffic sites. [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev), on the other hand, pre-builds your site into static files, making it lightning-fast for end users. Static files are also better for SEO since page speed is a ranking factor.

#### **Security**

WordPress's complexity can be a double-edged sword. Its reliance on plugins and databases introduces vulnerabilities that often make it a target for hackers. With [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev), your site is static, meaning there's no database to breach or server-side scripts to exploit. It's inherently more secure.

#### **Developer Control**

[Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) is a developer-first tool. Unlike WordPress, which can feel bloated with unnecessary features, [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) gives you full control over the codebase. You decide on the structure, templating language, and build process, without being locked into a proprietary ecosystem.

#### **No Bloat**

WordPress sites often accumulate "plugin creep," where additional plugins are installed for minor functionality, resulting in unnecessary overhead. [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) is lean by design, letting you build only what you need.


### **2. Eleventy vs. Jekyll**

Jekyll has been a staple of the SSG community for years, especially for GitHub Pages. But [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) has several advantages that make it a better choice in most cases:

#### **Speed of Development**

Jekyll relies on Ruby, which can have a steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the language. [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev), written in JavaScript, leverages a language most web developers already know. This makes it easier to onboard and maintain projects.

#### **Flexibility**

While Jekyll is tied to its Liquid templating system, [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) supports multiple templating languages, including Markdown, Nunjucks, Liquid, and Handlebars. This flexibility allows you to pick the right tool for your specific needs or even mix and match templates within a single project.

#### **Modern Ecosystem**

[Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) integrates seamlessly with modern JavaScript tooling, such as npm and bundlers like Vite. It also supports advanced features like serverless functions and API-driven workflows, making it more versatile than Jekyll for modern web projects.

#### **Simplified Build Process**

[Eleventy](https://1ty.dev)'s setup is refreshingly simple. It doesn't require a rigid folder structure or opinionated defaults. You can drop files in any directory and configure the build process to your liking, which is much harder to achieve with Jekyll.



### **What Makes Eleventy Truly Special?**

1.  **Minimalism Meets Power**: [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev)'s "zero config" philosophy means you can get started quickly, but it also offers deep customization options for complex projects.
2.  **Data Agnosticism**: [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) lets you pull content from almost anywhere---Markdown files, CMS APIs, JSON files, or even JavaScript functions. This makes it highly adaptable for projects of all sizes.
3.  **Community-Driven**: [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev)'s open-source community is active and innovative, consistently contributing plugins and best practices.
4.  **Eco-Friendly**: Static sites built with [Eleventy](https://1ty.dev) require fewer server resources, aligning with sustainable web development practices.
