## Abstract

The Download is where we bring you up to speed on all things digital when it comes to working in our field. In this issue, we are pleased to have a piece from Adam DJ Brett. Many of us have been working long enough to know that technologies change and fade away. Brett gives us a framework for thinking about how to make sure our content is built to last.
